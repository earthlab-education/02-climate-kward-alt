        "# Climate Change in Ramona\n",
        "\n",
        "Climate change is threatening already high-drought regions in the US. This problem is especially true for Southwestern states. In California, rising temperatures are a major threat to both people and the environment. This problem is no less prevalent in the community of Ramona, a unincorportated community located Northeast of San Diego County. In the brief data exploration below, you will see how rising temperatures in Ramona over the past 100 years has increased rapidly. This exploration also provides the code and NCEI station data should you want to run this data yourself! You can visit https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/ to find your own community to replicate this with.\n",

Under each library a discription provided of what that particular library will help us accomplish in visualizing Ramona's annual average temperatures over time. The particular data we are using comes from a NOAA weather station (ID: USW00053120) near the Ramona Airport in Ramona, CA (33.038025, -116.915989). This particular station provides the average temperature (TAVG), the maximum temperature (TMAX) and the minimum temperature (TMIN).\n",

"- earthpy – Is a helper library that simplifies access to spatial data and common Earth-science workflows, such as working with raster and vector files, stacking bands, and visualizing environmental datasets.\n",
"- pandas (pd) – Provides powerful tools for data manipulation and analysis, with DataFrame and Series objects that make it easy to clean, aggregate, and reshape tabular data. You will see DataFrames used a lot in this data exploration. These are abbreviated in python as 'df'\n",
"- holoviews (hv) – Is a visualization library that simplifies the creation of interactive plots by linking data directly to visual representations. It integrates seamlessly with  Matplotlib, which we will use for plotting our OLS regression later.\n",
"- hvplot.pandas – Adds an .hvplot() method to pandas objects, enabling quick creation of interactive HoloViews plots from DataFrames.

numpy (np) – Offers support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a wide collection of mathematical functions to operate on these efficiently.

matplotlib.pyplot (plt) – The foundational plotting library in Python; provides control over static charts such as line plots, histograms, and scatterplots.

seaborn (sns) – Built on top of Matplotlib, it provides a high-level interface for creating attractive, statistically-informed visualizations with minimal code.

scikit-learn (LinearRegression) – A machine learning library; the LinearRegression class fits ordinary least squares (OLS) linear models, useful for trend and predictive analysis.
